## ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND & RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Must Fix Before Deploy)

None! Your site is ready to deploy.

---

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Recommended)

#### 1. **Delete home.html**
**Issue**: The `home.html` file is a hosting provider placeholder and should be deleted.
**Impact**: Could confuse users if accessed
**Fix**: Delete the file

#### 2. **Mixed Image File Extensions**
**Issue**: Images have mixed cases (.jpg vs .JPG) and formats (.jfif)
**Impact**: Could cause issues on case-sensitive servers (Linux)
**Files affected**: 
- actividad2.JPG, actividad5.JPG, actividad6.JPG, actividad8.JPG, actividad11.JPG
- lugar1.JPG, gastronomia1.JPG, gastronomia5.jfif
**Fix**: Rename to lowercase extensions

#### 3. **Image Optimization**
**Issue**: Images not optimized for web
**Impact**: Slower page load (estimated 2-3 seconds)
**Fix**: 
- Convert to WebP format
- Compress to 80-90% quality
- Resize to appropriate dimensions
**Estimated improvement**: 50-60% file size reduction

#### 4. **API Endpoint Configuration**
**Issue**: `EMAIL_ENDPOINT` set to localhost
**Location**: `main.js` line 14
**Fix**: Update to production URL before deploy
```javascript
EMAIL_ENDPOINT: 'https://www.come2huelva.com/api/send-email'
```

---

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

#### 1. **CSS Minification**
**Current**: 26KB unminified
**Estimated**: 18KB minified (30% reduction)
**Tool**: cssnano or similar

#### 2. **JavaScript Minification**
**Current**: 62KB unminified
**Estimated**: 35KB minified (45% reduction)
**Tool**: Terser or UglifyJS

#### 3. **Add Source Maps**
**Benefit**: Easier debugging in production
**Implementation**: Generate .map files during build

#### 4. **Replace alert() Notifications**
**Current**: Using browser alerts for form feedback
**Recommendation**: Custom toast notifications
**Benefit**: Better UX, more professional

#### 5. **Add Loading States**
**Current**: No visual feedback during form submission
**Recommendation**: Add spinner or loading indicator
**Benefit**: Better UX
